A court case hangs over him relating to a shipyard lamp he smashed during protest against the closure. Jos\u00e9 is bitter that his wife, Ana, is employed when he is not.

Not everyone seems to agree including her boss. Lino, an aging family man doggedly pursuing positions beyond his qualifications. The oldest member of the group, Amador, has degenerated into alcoholism after being abandoned by his wife; maintaining an increasingly transparent pretense that his wife will soon return from holiday.",
